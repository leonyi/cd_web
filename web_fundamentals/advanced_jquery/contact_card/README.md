# Overview:

This project creates a contact card page.  A form takes the user input to generate the user contact details and using jQuery appends the cards to the page.  The user can see the description of the card on the back of the card by toggling between front and back.


# Pending Work
This is still work in progress and there is still work to be completed and bugs to be fixed.  The following lists the items pending:

1. Toggle should wokr on a per card basis - we currently click a single "description" button and all of them flip at the same time
2. Add more details to the front of the card using the email and phone number.
3. Add user input validation for name, email and phone number.i
