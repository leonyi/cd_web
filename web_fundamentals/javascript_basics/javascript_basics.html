				<h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
				<p class="js_description">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.  JavaScript lives inside a host environment(a web browser or Node server), it cat be connected to objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.
				</p>
				<ul class="jsdetails_list">
					<li><span class="underline_lightblue">Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers, <span class="light_purple">var x;</span>
					</li>
				    <li><span class="underline_lightblue">Variable Assignment</span> Assingment operators assing values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold.  The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="light_purple">var x;</span>
				    </li>
				    <li><span class="underline_lightblue">Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type.  There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives; Boolean - <span class="light_purple">true</span> or <span class="light_purple">false;</span> null - <span class="light_purple">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="light_purple">42</span>or <span class="light_purple">3.1415159;</span> String - <span class="light_purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="light_purple">[1, 'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Objects - <span class="light_purple">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: "Doe"}</span>
				    </li>
				    <li><span class="underline_lightblue">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met.  You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this.  There are the following conditional statements: <span class="light_purple">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="light_purple">else if</span>to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="light_purple">else</span> we execute this block of code.	
				    </li>
				    <li><span class="underline_lightblue">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing; they will repeat an action some number of times.  Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.  That's a loop!
				    </li>
				    <li><span class="underline_lightblue">Function</span> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block.  When we call our function this will run that code block.  Think of it as a list of instructions.  As an example imagine we re putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up.  Done! We finished our instructions.  Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
